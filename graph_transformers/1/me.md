A graph is a data structure consisting of a set of nodes (or vertices) V and a set of edges (or links) _E_ that connect pairs of nodes. Formally, a graph can be defined as _G = (V,E)_, where _V = {v1,v2,...,vN}_ is node set with N nodes and _E = {e1,e2,...,eM}_ is edge set with M edges. Edge ek = (vi , vj ) indicates the connection between node vi and node vj , where i,j ∈ {1,2,...,N} and k ∈ {1,2,...,M}. A graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix A ∈ RN ×N , where Aij indicates the presence or absence of an edge between node vi and node vj . Alternatively, a graph can be represented by the edge list E ∈ RM×2, where each row of E contains the indices of two nodes connected by an edge. A graph can also have node features and edge features that describe the attributes or properties of nodes and edges, respectively. The features of the nodes can be represented by a feature matrix X ∈ RN ×dn , where dn is the dimension of the node features. The edge features can be represented by a feature tensor F ∈ RM×de, where de is the dimension of the edge features [20].
