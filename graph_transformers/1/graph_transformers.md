# Graph Transformers: A Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction
Graph Transformers represent a significant advancement in the field of machine learning, particularly in handling graph-structured data. This document provides an in-depth overview of their architecture, applications, and key concepts.

### Why Graph Transformers?
- Traditional GNNs face limitations in capturing long-range dependencies
- Standard Transformers struggle with graph-structured data
- Graph Transformers bridge this gap by combining the best of both worlds

## What are Graph Transformers?
Graph Transformers are neural network architectures that combine the power of Transformer models with graph neural networks (GNNs). They are designed to process graph-structured data while maintaining the benefits of attention mechanisms.

### Historical Context

#### Mathematical Formulation
```python
# Simplified attention computation
attention_score = softmax(QK^T/âˆšd_k)
output = attention_score * V
```

### 2. Positional Encoding
#### Types of Positional Encodings
1. **Absolute Positional Encoding**

def relative_position_encoding(node_i, node_j):
    distance = shortest_path_length(node_i, node_j)
    return embedding_matrix[distance]
```
